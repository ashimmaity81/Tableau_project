A Tableau data science project involves analyzing and visualizing data through interactive dashboards to uncover insights and support decision-making.

The Bank Churn Prediction Dashboard, built using Tableau, is a comprehensive data visualization tool designed to analyze customer retention patterns in the banking sector. It provides key insights into customer demographics, financial stability, and churn behavior, enabling banks to identify high-risk customers and improve retention strategies. The dashboard showcases essential metrics such as total customers, active members, churned customers, average credit scores, and estimated salaries, allowing financial analysts to explore trends effectively. Interactive visualizations, including gender and age-wise distributions, tenure-based credit score analysis, and country-wise segmentation, help in understanding customer engagement across different regions. With dynamic filters for age, gender, and geography, users can drill down into specific datasets to make informed decisions. This data-driven approach enables banks to optimize marketing efforts, enhance customer satisfaction, and reduce churn rates by identifying patterns that influence customer exits. By integrating data science and visualization, this dashboard serves as a valuable tool for financial institutions looking to drive strategic, customer-centric growth.
